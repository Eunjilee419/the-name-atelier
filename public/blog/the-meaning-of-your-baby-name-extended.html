  <h1>The Meaning of Your Baby Name</h1>

  <p>Every name tells a story. Beyond trends and sound, a name can hold meaning, emotion, and even energetic balance. Whether you’re naming a baby, character, or brand — understanding what a name evokes can help you choose one that feels aligned.</p>

  <h2>🌱 Why Name Meaning Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Emotional tone:</strong> Some names feel soft and gentle, others bold and powerful.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy balance:</strong> A well-balanced name can reflect harmony, confidence, or calm.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal symbolism:</strong> Parents often choose names to reflect hopes, virtues, or nature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✨ Examples of Balanced Names</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Elara</strong> – Elegant and celestial, often seen as graceful and wise</li>
    <li><strong>Kai</strong> – Short and strong, linked to water and flow (used in many cultures)</li>
    <li><strong>Nova</strong> – Bright and bold, symbolizing new beginnings and energy</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔋 What Does "Name Energy" Mean?</h2>
  <p>Name energy refers to the emotional and symbolic “vibe” that a name gives off. Just as colors or sounds carry emotional weight, names do too. A name with sharp consonants may feel strong and commanding, while one with open vowels may feel gentle and soothing.</p>
  <p>Some cultures even align names with elements like fire, water, or earth. Choosing a name with intentional energy can help set a tone for how that person or brand is perceived.</p>

  <h2>🚫 Common Naming Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Overcomplicating the spelling:</strong> Keep it simple and easy to pronounce.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring global connotations:</strong> Make sure the name doesn't mean something negative in another language or culture.</li>
    <li><strong>Choosing purely trendy names:</strong> Trend-based names can age quickly and lose originality.</li>
  </ul>
